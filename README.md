# cpx-mat2by2

cpx-mat2by2 is a Rust library for representing and manipulating quantum states and operators in 2-dimensional Hilbert space (i.e., single qubits). It is designed to work seamlessly with the cpx-coords crate for complex number arithmetic in multiple coordinate systems.

This crate is part of the broader rust-quantum project, focused on efficient numerical quantum computation.
